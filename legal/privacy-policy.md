**Last Updated: February 10, 2026**

## Introduction

Barrie Transit Trip Planner ("the App") is a transit navigation application for the City of Barrie, Ontario. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Account Information**: If you create an account, we collect your email address and display name through Firebase Authentication.
- **Favorites and Preferences**: Saved stops, routes, and notification preferences are stored in your account.
- **Trip History**: Recent trip searches are stored to provide quick access to frequent routes.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Location Data**: With your permission, we access your device's location to show nearby transit stops and provide walking directions. Location data is used in real-time and is not stored on our servers.
- **Transit Data Usage**: The App downloads publicly available GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data from Barrie Transit to provide schedules, routes, and real-time vehicle positions.
- **Device Information**: We collect basic device information (device type, operating system) for crash reporting and app stability purposes.
- **Push Notification Tokens**: If you enable notifications, we store your device's push notification token to send trip reminders and service alerts.

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect or store your precise location history.
- We do not collect payment or financial information.
- We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Provide Transit Services**: Display nearby stops, plan trips, and show real-time bus positions.
- **Personalization**: Save your favorite stops and routes for quick access.
- **Notifications**: Send trip reminders and service alerts you have opted into.
- **App Improvement**: Aggregate, anonymized usage data helps us improve the App's performance and reliability.
- **Crash Reporting**: Error data is collected to identify and fix bugs.

## Data Storage and Security

- Account data and preferences are stored securely using Google Firebase (Firestore and Firebase Authentication).
- Data is transmitted using HTTPS encryption.
- Firebase Security Rules restrict access so users can only read and modify their own data.
- Locally cached data (for offline use) is stored on your device using the platform's standard storage mechanisms.
