# Account Deletion — My Barrie Transit

**Last Updated: February 14, 2026**

## How to Delete Your Account

You can delete your account directly within the app:

1. Open **My Barrie Transit**
2. Tap the **Profile** tab
3. Tap **Settings**
4. Tap **Delete Account**
5. Confirm the deletion when prompted

Your account and all associated data will be permanently deleted.

## What Data Is Deleted

When you delete your account, the following data is permanently removed:

- **Account information** — email address, display name, profile photo
- **Favorite stops and routes** — all saved favorites
- **Trip history** — all recent trip searches
- **Notification preferences** — alert settings and push notification token
- **User settings** — map preferences, accessibility settings

## What Data Is NOT Affected

- **Locally cached data** (transit schedules, stop data) remains on your device. You can clear this from Settings → Clear Cache, or by uninstalling the app.
- **Crash reports** previously sent to our error tracking service (Sentry) are anonymized and cannot be linked back to your account.

## Timeline

Account deletion is processed immediately. All personal data is permanently removed from our servers (Firebase) within 30 days.

## Without an Account

My Barrie Transit works fully without an account. After deletion, you can continue using the app — your favorites and trip history will simply be stored locally on your device instead of synced to the cloud.
