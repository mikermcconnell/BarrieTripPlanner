By downloading, installing, or using the Barrie Transit Trip Planner ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## 3. Transit Data Accuracy

**Important**: The App relies on data provided by Barrie Transit through publicly available GTFS feeds. While we strive to present accurate information:

- **Schedules may change** without notice due to weather, construction, special events, or service adjustments.
- **Real-time positions** are dependent on GPS equipment on buses and may occasionally be unavailable or delayed.
- **Trip plans are estimates** and do not guarantee connections or travel times.
- **Always confirm critical trips** by checking Barrie Transit's official website or contacting them directly.

The App is provided as a convenience tool and should not be your sole source of transit information for time-critical travel.
