## Conversation Flow Tips

### Natural Transitions
Move between topics smoothly without abrupt changes:

- **Build on their answer:** "That reminds me..." or "Speaking of [topic]..."
- **Show genuine curiosity:** "I'd love to hear more about that" or "What was that like?"
- **Find connection points:** "That's interesting because I..." or "I've been curious about that too"

### The 70/30 Rule
Aim for them to talk ~70% of the time. Your job is to:
1. Ask good questions
2. Listen actively
3. Share briefly to build connection, then redirect back to them

### Topic Threading
Keep mental notes of interesting threads you can return to:
- "Earlier you mentioned [X] - I'd love to hear more about that"
- "Going back to what you said about [Y]..."

---

## Active Listening Follow-Ups

### After Any Answer, You Can:

**Go Deeper:**
- "What made you feel that way?"
- "How did that change things for you?"
- "What happened next?"

**Show Understanding:**
- "That sounds [challenging/exciting/meaningful]..."
- "I can see why that would matter to you"
- Paraphrase: "So basically, [restate their point]?"

**Connect:**
- "I've felt something similar when..."
- "That resonates because..."
- "I've wondered about that too"

**Expand:**
- "What else comes to mind?"
- "Is there a specific example?"
- "How does that compare to [related topic]?"

### The Magic Follow-Up
When in doubt: **"Tell me more about that."**

## Awkward Moment Recovery

### When Conversation Stalls

**Redirect with curiosity:**
- "I've been wanting to ask you - [new question]"
- "Oh, that reminds me - [pivot to new topic]"
- "Random question - [introduce fresh angle]"

**Return to a thread:**
- "Going back to what you said earlier about [X]..."
- "I've been thinking about what you said about [Y]"

**Acknowledge and reset:**
- "I feel like we covered that well - what else is on your mind?"
- Light humor: "Okay, rapid fire round - [easy question]"

### When You Said Something Awkward

- Don't over-apologize - brief acknowledgment and move on
- "Anyway - [redirect to them]"
- Ask them a question to shift focus

### When They Give Short Answers

They might be:
- Shy - try easier, more specific questions
- Distracted - check if it's a good time
- Not interested in the topic - pivot to something else

Try: "What's something you've been excited about lately?" (open-ended, positive)
